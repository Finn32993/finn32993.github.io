                    <h4>Forces in Particle Physics</h4>
                    <h5>Strong nuclear force</h5>
                    <p>As you know the components of atoms are protons and neutrons. But like you can read in the
                        Standard Model
                        you can go even smaller.
                    <p> Then you get to quarks. Now one can wonder why the quarks can hold
                        together to form
                        protons neutrons or other hadrons.</p>
                    <p> The awnser to this question is the strong nuclear force. This
                        Force is
                        one million times stronger than the electromagnatic force. Due to the strong force, the
                        interaction energy of the particles is enormous. Since mass directly corresponds
                        to energy about 99% of the mass of protons and neutrons is due to the strong nuclear force.</p>

                    <h5>Weak nuclear force</h5>
                    <p>
                        Unlike the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force is not an interaction between different
                        quarks but
                        an interaction between different nucleons. However, the force carrying bosons can change the
                        kind of a quark.
                        The weak nuclear force plays part in nuclear fission and fusion. During beta- decay a down quark
                        inside a
                        neutron gets changed to an up quark, which results in the neutron turning into a proton and an
                        electron
                        getting ejected out of the atom. The Force carriers of the weak force are W+, W- and Z0 Bosons.
