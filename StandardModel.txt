Standard Model:

The standard model is the theory that is explaining the fundamental forces and the known elementary particles.
It is devided into 2 main parts. Fermoins and bosons. Fermoins are the forms of matter like electrons, while
bosons are carriers of Forces like photons. Fermoins are further devided into leptons and 1uarks. Quarks are
subject to the strong nuclear force, which doesn't affect leptons. Each quark and lepton have a anti-part.
The standard model was developed over a long time with some quite "recent" additions. For example the higgs
boson was only discovered in 2011-2013 after it was theorised in 1964
