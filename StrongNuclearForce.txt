strong nuclear force:

As you know the components of atoms are protons and neutrons. But like you can read in the Standard Model
you can go even smaller. Then you get to quarks. Now one can wonder why the quarks can hold together to form
protons neutrons or other hadrons. The awnser to this question is the strong nuclear force. This Force is
one million times stronger than the electromagnatic force. Due to the strong force, the interaction energy of the particles is enormous. Since mass directly corresponds
to energy about 99% of the mass of protons and neutrons is due to the strong nuclear force.
