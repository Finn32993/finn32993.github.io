weak nuclear force:

Unlike the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force is not an interaction between different quarks but
an interaction between different nucleons. However, the force carrying bosons can change the kind of a quark.
The weak nuclear force plays part in nuclear fission and fusion. During beta- decay a down quark inside a
neutron gets changed to an up quark, which results in the neutron turning into a proton and an electron
getting ejected out of the atom. The Force carriers of the weak force are W+, W- and Z0 Bosons.
